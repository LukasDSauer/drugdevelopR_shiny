# drugdevelopR: Utility-based optimal phase II/III drug development planning.

The drugdevelopR R shiny applications enable you to plan phase II/III drug
development programs with optimal sample size allocation and go/no-go
decision rules. It has a graphic user interface and thus makes it accessible for
users without prior knowledge of R. The assumed true treatment effects are modelled fixed. 
The corresponding [package](https://github.com/Sterniii3/drugdevelopR) 
allows the usage of prior distributions and more functionality, while faster computing is made possible by
parallel programming. Theoretical foundations for this R shiny application were laid
in the dissertation “Integrated Planning of Pilot and Subsequent
Confirmatory Study in Clinical Research – Finding Optimal Designs in a
Utility-Based Framework” by Stella Erdmann at the Institute of Medical
Biometry at the University of Heidelberg.
