### multiarm - Version 1.1

* multiarm was reworked to also use reactive data sets.

### bias - Version 1.1

* bias was reworked so that data sets are no longer saved as `.Rdata` but are passed implicitly using reactive functions and the `session` object. In the next update, this will also be done with the other apps.
